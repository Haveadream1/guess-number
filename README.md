# Guess the correct number

The main function will randomly choose a number between your defined range, and our goal is to guess the correct one in a maximum of 5 tries.  
The function verifies the input, as it cannot be more than the range defined or a negative.

## Goal

The purpose of this project is to practice Python with a simple game.

## TODO:
Implement the hint version  
    *Your guess is smaller / bigger than the computer choice
